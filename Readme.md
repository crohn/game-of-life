# `game-of-life`

This is a Conway's Game of Life Rust implementation, featuring ASCII art, kitty
protocol and SDL2 rendering.

You can run any of the three implementations by issuing the commands
```txt
$ cargo run --release --bin game-of-ascii

$ cargo run --release --bin game-of-kitty

$ cargo run --release --bin game-of-sdl2
```

This is an educational project, an excuse to enjoy programming out of worklife
and explore game loop architecture.
